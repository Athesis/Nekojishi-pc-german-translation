Grand Tree Lord （樹王公, Shuwanggong）

In some Chinese traditions, people tie a red strip of cloth to an old tree as a rite that acknowledge such tree has its soul. For some very old trees, people may even build temples for them and enshrine them as gods. Those tree gods are called Grand Tree Lord.

Grand Tree Lords are local gods like gods of soil, protecting their villages but are not considered as high-level gods. Most Grand Tree Lords are Banyan tree or camphor tree.
