Princess Baleng

Princess Baleng is the heroine of a famous Rukai legend. This story has many versions since Rukai language doesn't have its own letters, and the story only spread through word of mouth.

Baleng was the daughter of the leader of Dadele tribe. She met a young man one day and soon fell in love with him. When the couple went back to the tribe with the young man's clansmen, what Baleng's family saw were dozens of snakes. It turned out that the young man was the monarch of the snakes' kingdom.
