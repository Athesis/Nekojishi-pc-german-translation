Memorial Meeting in Chinese Tradition

In the memorial meeting, the relatives may light incense as a way of mourning for the deceased. However, non-relatives such as colleagues and friends cannot light incense. They may only pick up some incense ash and sprinkle them down, as the final salute to the deceased.

This tradition is considered to be originated from Buddhism and is commonly seen in many Asian countries.
