Poe Divination （擲茭, Zhi Jiao）

Poe Divination (lit. "throwing poe") is a traditional Chinese divination method, in which the divination seeker throws or drops two little wooden pieces (poes, or Jiao Bei in Mandarin, lit. "bamboo cups") on the floor and gets the divine answer by the positions of the pieces whether the future course being contemplated is recommended or not.

Poes are made out of wood or bamboo and carved into a crescent shape. Each poe is round on one side (the Yin side) and flat on the other (the Yang side). There are four possible answers that the divination can produce:

Holy Poe: One poe flat and another round is a "yes".

Angry Poe: Both poes round is a "no". It is said the gods are displeased by the question.

Laughing Poe: Both poes flat. It can have different interpretations since "laughing" means the gods are laughing at the question. Normally it means the answer to the question is too obvious, and the querent should not bother gods for such easy question.

Standing Poe: One or both poes fall but stand erect on the floor. It indicates that the gods do not understand the referent's question.
