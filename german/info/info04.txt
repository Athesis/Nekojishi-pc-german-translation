Holy Mother (天上聖母, Tianshang Shengmu)

Often known as Mazu (媽祖, lit. "mother-ancestor")or Tianhou (天后, lit. "Empress of Heaven"), she is the Chinese patron goddess who protects seafarers. Mazu is widely worshiped in the coastal regions of China and other places in East/Southeast Asia.

According to legend, Mazu was born during the Song Dynasty on Meizhou Island, Fujian. She had the name Lin Moniang (林默娘, Lin is the family name and Moniang means "Silent Girl"). When Mazu was young, she wore red garments while standing on the shore to guide fishing boats home, even in the most dangerous and harsh weather. It is rumored that she can predict the weather, helping sailors to know when should they set sail. When Mazu died at the age of 28, local people believed that she flew to heaven and became a goddess.

Starting from Fujian, worship of Mazu spread to the neighboring coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong, and thence to all coastal areas of mainland China. With emigration and especially the Chinese diaspora of the 19th and 20th centuries, it further spread to Taiwan, Vietnam, Ryukyu, Japan, and South East Asia; The role of Mazu as patron of the seas caused newly arrived immigrants to often build temples of her first, showing their gratitude on the safe journey. Today, worship of Mazu is also found in other countries with sizable populations from these regions.
