Chi

Chi (lit. "breath", "air", or "gas") represents "material energy" in traditional Chinese culture.

Simply speaking, Chi is believed to be an active principle forming a part of every living thing. However, in some theories, Chi is actually the basic substance that forms everything, which implies a traditional opinion in Chinese culture that everything has life.

In this case, both "visible things" and "invisible things" are made of Chi. So are gods and spirits. But normally when people talk about Chi, they mean energies that imperceptible by humans.

Therefore, when gods consume Chi from foods, ordinary people don't notice anything.
