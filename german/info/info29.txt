Guanyin （觀音）

Guanyin, named from the Sanskrit Avalokitasvara, which means "sound perceiver", is an East Asian bodhisattva that commonly known as the "Goddess of Mercy". Guanyin is one of the most famous gods to Chinese people.

According to the needs and requests of the worshippers, a bodhisattva may appear as a male or a female. Therefore, we may also say that a bodhisattva doesn’t have a gender. Guanyin statues in China built before Tang Dynasty are mostly male, but now most people consider Guanyin as a female, which is also the origin of "Goddess of Mercy".
