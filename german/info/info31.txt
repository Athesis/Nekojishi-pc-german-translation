The Chief God

A temple usually doesn't enshrine only one god. According to the needs of their worshippers, the temple may place statues of multiple gods for people to worship. Typically, there are four types of god in a big temple:

The Chief God: The god primarily worshipped in the temple. People usually name the temple with the god's name/title. For example: Mazu Temple.

Secondary Gods: Secondary gods are gods that related to the chief god, including the chief god's spouse, subordinates, and guards.

Temple-Sharing Gods: They don't have specific relations with the chief god, but they are enshrined in the same temple for some reason.

Visiting Gods: Gods enshrined in other temples with their statues temporarily placed in the temple.

For example, many gods of soil have guardian tigers as their guard/ride. In such case, the god of soil is the chief god of the god of soil temple and the guardian tiger is a secondary god of this temple.
