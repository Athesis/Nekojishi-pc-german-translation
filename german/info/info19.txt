Kochapongane

Kochapongane is a Rukai tribe located in Wutai, Pingtung. According to the legend, a clouded leopard lead the tribe to a place called Kochapongane six hundred years ago, and the tribe settled there.

However, the Kochapongane on maps today is not the same place mentioned above since the entire tribe had to move for a better environment between 1977 and 1979.
