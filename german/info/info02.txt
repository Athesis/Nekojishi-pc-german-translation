Jitong (乩童)

In Chinese folk religion, a Jitong, or Tongji (lit. "divining youth" or "youth diviner") is a person believed to have been chosen by the deities to serve as a medium between them and humans. 

The deities choose the Jitong as a representative to communicate with their people, while the people can ask them questions through Jitong. However, a deity will only possess the body of the Jitong when he/she needs to say something. 

Therefore, consulting a Jitong at the right time is basically consulting a deity. Many temples have specific time when people can consult Jitong.
