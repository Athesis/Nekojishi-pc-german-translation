Wild Boar Sausage

There are many wild boars in the mountains of Taiwan, and boar cuisine is an indispensable part of Taiwanese aboriginal culture.

In the past, a roast boar was enough for an entire tribes dinner. Nowadays people condense the ingredients of roast boar into a small sausage, and city people get a chance to enjoy this delicacy.
  
Stone BBQ and bamboo rice are also very popular in Taiwan, and they are considered modern aboriginal cuisine.
