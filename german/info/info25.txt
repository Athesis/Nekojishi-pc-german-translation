Orthodox God

As Yin and Yang may refer to "under the surface" and "on the surface" correspondingly, Taoism temples fall into two categories: Yang Temple and Yin Temple.

A Yang Temple is a temple that enshrine a god (or multiple gods) with "genuine godship", which means the god has been authenticated by The Jade Emperor or a human emperor. A god with genuine godship may be called an orthodox god.

Similarly, a Yin Temple is a temple that enshrine a god (or multiple gods) without "genuine godship". Normally, a Yin Temple is built by local people to serve local ghosts or yaoguais as gods to calm them and prevent them from harming people.
