Yaoguai

Yaoguai (lit. the evil and strange), is a Chinese term that generally means "demon". Traditionally, Han people (China's largest ethnic group) believe that animals and lifeless things may obtain souls and human wisdoms if they are old enough. This kind of yaoguai is usually called "Jing" (lit. the sprite), for example: Hulijing means "fox sprite" while "huli" means "fox". With the growth of their life, yaoguais may achieve skills such as speaking human language, changing the appearance and possessing others
