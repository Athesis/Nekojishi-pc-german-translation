Roast Suckling Pig

Roast suckling pig is a traditional Chinese cuisine with long history. Similar cuisines can also be found in other cultures around the world.

Traditionally, roast suckling pig is a whole pig, but smaller sizes are more popular these days. You can even find them in night markets.

In Chinese tradition, the pig is an important sacrifice. Nowadays Cantonese style suckling pig is well-known across the world, probably because local people pay a lot of respect to the sacrifice traditions.

In a formal sacrifice rite, three kinds of sacrifice must be prepared: raw, half-cooked, and well-cooked. 

According to some traditions, raw sacrifices are for the guardian tigers, half-cooked sacrifices are for the primal gods, and well-cooked sacrifices are for the ancestors. However, ordinary families won't spend too much on this when they can just use one roast suckling pig.
