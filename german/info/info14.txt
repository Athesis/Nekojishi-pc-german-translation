Kaidao (開道)

In the Mazu culture, Kaidao (lit. "clear the path") is a rite in the Holy Pilgrimage. During the Kaidao rite, guardian tigers lead the way and expel devils on route for all other gods in the pilgrimage.
　　
The Holy Pilgrimage is a ceremony where worshippers bring large god statues on a grand tour. People believe that gods can inspect their domain and see their people during the tour.
