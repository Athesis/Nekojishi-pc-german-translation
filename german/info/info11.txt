Leopard Cat (石虎, Shihu)

The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is a small wild cat native to South and East Asia. A leopard cat is about the size of a domestic cat, but slenderer, with longer legs and well-defined webs between its toes. Its small head is marked with two prominent dark stripes and a short and narrow white muzzle. 

People in Taiwan refer leopard cats as Shihu (lit. "Stone tiger"), which means "Tiger residing between the stones". (So it's a tiger somehow)

The leopard cat is currently listed as an endangered species in Taiwan, with an estimated population of below 500.
