Rukai Spirit Mediums

Rukai people communicate with their gods through the help of spirit mediums, such as oracles (barakalai) and witch doctors (taraivigi).

There's only one oracle in each tribe to take care of major ceremonies. The oracle, who must be male, is selected by the nobility of the tribe and his residence is called tabarakaladhane, which is also considered as the residence of gods.

On the other hand, there can be many witch doctors in a tribe. Witch doctors are female and are believed to heal people with the power of a god called Pelenge.
