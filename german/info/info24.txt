Old Street Snacks

The street village in Nekojishi is based on a real attraction in Taipei. Both millet mochi and iced hot spring egg are specialties over there.

Mochi, or rice cake, is a traditional food in Southern China, usually made from sticky rice. Millet is rarely planted in Southern China but is a staple food of the Amis tribe in Taiwan. Therefore, millet mochi can be considered as a dessert that compromises the history of Han and Amis people.

Iced hot spring eggs are made by putting a boiled egg into ice water. The egg is boiled with hot spring water so it has a special aroma that's hard to duplicate.
